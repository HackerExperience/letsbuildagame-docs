# Overview

We decided to split the project implementation in phases. This will allow us to better focus our resources on more important issues, that should be solved in each phase.

# Foundation (Phase I)

## Overview

The first phase is where we define the foundations of the game. Roughly, this is where we describe the game we want to create.

Roughly, what we need to have ready on this phase is:

- Game name (tentative)
- Game genre
- Game principles
- Game objectives
  - Identification of target audience
  - Main platforms
- Base game concept: 
  - Base gameplay
  - Base storyline

As you can see, those are very fundamental and basic aspects of the game. And those have already been done for Hacker Experience 2.

Before proceeding, let's explain the word *base*. Having a *base* gameplay, or *base* storyline is intended to serve as template, or direction, for the next phases, where contributors will extend those concepts.

This is the reason we say HE2 will be a hacking game, even if we are unsure about how the final game design will be. We've shaped our basic concepts to match the one of a hacking game.

## Rationale

Phase I serves the main purpose of defining what the game is, and what it will be about. As long as the upcoming changes extend the concepts on the same basis, the final product will be shaped by these foundations.

# Concepts (Phase II)

## Overview

The Phase II aims to further expand the base gameplay and storyline defined on Phase I. By the end of Phase II, we are expected to have a set of *core* concepts.

- Core game concept
  - Core gameplay
  - Core storyline

Notice the subtle change from *base* to *core*. On Phase II, we firm game mechanics that make a good part of the game.

Core game mechanics include features we would like to see *still* on the first few releases of the game (within 3-6 months of publication). Game mechanics that are on the Roadmap, but would take too long to implement still can make as core, but it needs to be tagged as "Wishlist" or "Future".

## Rationale

With a predefined set of core concepts, we now have something to expect as the final version. Phase I shapes the way we want to follow, and Phase II paves it. 

That way, if by the end of Phase II we do not like the set of features we have, then we know very early that the final product probably will suck. 

The reverse is true: If we like the game described on Phase II, no matter how long it takes to finish the implementation, we know that the final product will be just as awesome - as long as executed properly.

**NOTE:** This is one of the most important phases, and the one we actively need your input. After all, this is the phase that shapes the entire gameplay, so this is the best time to share your ideas/suggestions.

Also note that, while most concepts are created during Phase II, *it is okay to suggest features after Phase II has been closed.* That's why Phase II and Phase III go on forever.

# Game Design (Phase III)

## Overview

The Phase III has the sole purpose of validating the concepts we've created on Phase I and II. This is the time our awesome Game Designers open their spreadsheets and do weird calculations.

During this phase (which takes very long) they work relentlessly on making sure there are no loopholes or disbalance on features.

By the way, *balance* is the key word during this phase. And it is not a tiny bit easy.

## Rationale

On Phase II we *described* the game we want, on lay terms. Of course we gave some thought when we were writing those concepts, but not with the ideal depth or context.

Now, on Phase III, we have the whole game described and we can analyze each feature in details.

Whenever a feature is rejected, or deemed impracticable, we go back to Phase II and check if its possible to rewrite this feature on a better way. 

Phase III happens concurrently with next phases.

# Technical Planning (Phase IV)

## Overview

On this phase, we choose the technology stack we are going to use. We take in consideration how many requests per second we plan to handle, and how we will be able to scale it out.

## Rationale

This Phase is intended to be
