# Overview

We decided to split the project implementation in phases. This will allow us to better focus our resources on more important issues, that should be solved in each phase.

# Foundation (Phase I)

The first phase is where we define the foundations of the game. Roughly, this is where we describe the game we want to create.

Roughly, what we need to have ready on this phase is:

- Game name (tentative)
- Game genre
- Game objectives
- Game principles
- Base game concept: 
  - Base gameplay
  - Base storyline

As you can see, those are very fundamental and basic aspects of the game. And those have already been done for Hacker Experience 2.

Before proceeding, let's explain the word *base*. Having a *base* gameplay, or *base* storyline is intended to serve as template, or direction, for the next phases, where contributors will extend those concepts.

This is the reason we say HE2 will be a hacking game, even if we are unsure about how the final game design will be. We've shaped our basic concepts to match the one of a hacking game.
