# Overview

We decided to split the project implementation in phases. This will allow us to better focus our resources on more important issues, that should be solved in each phase.

# Foundation (Phase I)

The first phase is where we define the foundations of the game. Roughly, this is where we describe the game we want to create.

Roughly, what we need to have ready on this phase is:

- Game name (tentative)
- Game genre
- Game objectives
- Game principles
- Base game concept: 
  - Base gameplay
  - Base storyline

As you can see, those are very fundamental and basic aspects of the game. And those have already been done for Hacker Experience 2.



# Concepts (Phase II)

# Game Design (Phase III)
