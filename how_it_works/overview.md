# Working in group

This is an attempt to describe how we plan to build a game together, with so many different people working on the same thing.

Here's a quick view of our challenge:

- Hundreds of contributors; all or many with different
 - opinions 
 - political views
 - likes and dislikes
 - expectations
 - knowledge
 - area of work
 - timezone

It's easy to conclude that *it's impossible to create a game that's exactly what all of us want*. That's not LBAG's purpose.

Let's Build a Game main goal is to show to the world, and to ourselves, that we can work together, as one,  and bring complex systems to life. We did so with the Pyramids. We are doing so with Linux. And we can do so with LBAG.

# Handling disagreements

With such heterogeneous group, it's simply a matter of time until we get into disagreements about how to implement a feature, how to present a game mechanic or how to drive the project forward.

In such cases, we must check the quality of arguments from each side. We may host polls to get the overall sentiment. We must take into consideration the side-effects of each choice, specially to the final user (the player).

For most disagreements I believe the community itself will be able to reach a consensus (or majority). Our in-house team will moderate the discussions to make sure it is fair and objective. Swear words and *ad hominem* will not be tolerated.

If the community fails to reach a consensus, or the issue gets out of hand, our Benevolent Dictator For Life will hold the final word, always having in mind the best to the community.

# Accepting disagreements

Sometimes we have to agree to disagree. It's okay. It's part of life. And it will happen on such dynamic group.

If your idea does not get accepted, or someone rejects your feature request, don't take it personally. You should require a straightforward, objective answer to *why* it was rejected.

If the rejection explanation is well-grounded, even if you do not agree with, you should accept it. It's part of the democratic process.

However, if you believe the explanation is nonsensical or wrong, you should report it and explain why its wrong. Then, an unbiased person can review both sides and reach to a final conclusion.

If no in-house member is involved, we are more than happy to provide that unbiased person. If someone is, we'll ask the contributor group to make a poll and vote on favor or against the decision. All of this will happen in public.
