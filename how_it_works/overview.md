# Working in group

This is an attempt to describe how we plan to build a game together, with so many different people working on the same thing.

Here's a quick view of our challenge:

- Dozens of contributors; all or many with different
 - opinions 
 - political views
 - likes and dislikes
 - expectations
 - knowledge
 - area of work
 - timezone

It's easy to conclude that *it's impossible to create a game that's exactly what all of them want*. That's not LBAG's purpose.

Let's Build a Game main goal is to show to the world, and to ourselves, that we can work together, as one,  and bring complex systems to life. We did so with the Pyramids. We are doing so with Linux. And we can do so with LBAG.

# Handling disagreements

With such heterogeneous group, it's simply a matter of time until we get into disagreements about how to implement a feature, how to present a game mechanic or how to drive the project forward.
