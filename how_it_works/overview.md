# Working in group

This is an attempt to describe how we plan to build a game together, with so many different people working on the same thing.

Here's a quick view of our challenge:

- Dozens of contributors; all or many with different
 - opinions 
 - political views
 - likes and dislikes
 - expectations
 - knowledge
 - area of work
 - timezone

It's easy to conclude that *it's impossible to create a game that's exactly what all of them want*.
