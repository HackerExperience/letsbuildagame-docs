# Let's Build a Game

Let's Build a Game (LBAG) is a project to allow gamers, developers, designers and interested people to build a game together.

LBAG aims to create a user-friendly collaborative environment, so technical and non-technical people alike can collaborate and build together and in harmony.

Even though many open source projects exist today, newcomers find it hard to collaborate. They feel intimidated or confused about the complex work flow of the software. LBAG wants to lessen this "collaboration curve" and bring new people to open source software development. We also want to increase the interest of young men and women on Computer Science.

# Which game?

LBAG's first game is an ambitious project called Hacker Experience 2 (HE2). Just like LBAG itself, Hacker Experience 2 wants to bring more people to Computer Science by teaching, in a fun way, concepts of network, security, software development and more.

Our in-house team built core concepts about HE2, including base game mechanics, what it will be like, what to expect, etc. From these concepts, contributors will expand and shape the final version of the game. Those concepts are simple and very flexible, it's just a way to make sure the game keeps on its intended direction.

# What about the game license?

Hacker Experience 2 will use the AGPL License, an FSF-approved license that gives you the freedom to copy, modify, study and redistribute the software.

Note that the word *free*, in free software, has the same meaning as freedom, not necessarily as in free beer/*gratis*.

You will be able to play Hacker Experience 2 for free (*gratis*) by downloading and installing both the client and server software. Then, you can invite as many friends as you'd like to play with you. 

We will do our best to have an easy-to-install server software, but it probably will require a powerful machine (6G+ RAM, 4+ cores CPU) and Linux OS (may run on Windows/OS X with VM software).

Neoart Labs, the company who created Hacker Experience 1 and is sponsoring the in-house team of Hacker Experience 2, will offer an online hosted ad-free version of the game for a small monthly subscription. Read more about HE2 and Neoart Labs' principles.
